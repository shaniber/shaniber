### shaniber's README.md

Hi There! My name is Shane Doucette (he/him). I'm an IT Specialist, System Administrator, and computer tinkerer. 

Please feel free to look around my public repos. I use GitHub for experimentation, and to explore hobby projects. 

Some of my professional interests include Bash scripting and system administration. Personally and recreationally, I like cooking, Minecraft, and role playing games like D&D and Pathfinder. Behind the scenes, I'm exploring personal dashboarding, tasklist management, and perl programming. 

Have questions? Hit me up shane «at» doucette «dot» org.
