### shaniber's README.md

Hi There! Please feel free to look around my public repos. I use GitHub for experimentation, and to explore hobby projects. 

Some of my professional interests include Bash scripting and system administration. Personally and recreationally, I like cooking, Minecraft, and role playing games like D&D and Pathfinder. Behind the scenes, I'm exploring personal dashboarding, tasklist management, and perl programming. 

Have questions? Hit me up shane Â«atÂ» doucette Â«dotÂ» org.
